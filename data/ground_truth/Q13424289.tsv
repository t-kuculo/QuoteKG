en: Saying that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say. It’s a deeply anti social principle because rights are not just individual, they’re collective, and what may not have value to you today may have value to an entire population, an entire people, an entire way of life tomorrow. And if you don’t stand up for it, then who will?

If I wanted to see your emails or your wife's phone, all I have to do is use intercepts. I can get your emails, passwords, phone records, credit cards. I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of things... I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded. That is not something I am willing to support or live under.

I'm not going to pull the trigger. Trust me.'	it: La National Security Agency ha i più grandi mezzi di sorveglianza della storia. Quello che sostengono è che non li usano per scopi nefasti contro i cittadini americani. In un certo senso questo è vero, ma il vero problema è che stanno usando questi mezzi per renderci vulnerabili dicendo: "Be', ho una pistola puntata alla tua testa, ma non ho intenzione di premere il grilletto, fidati.
en: The conversation occurring today will determine the amount of trust we can place both in the technology that surrounds us and the government that regulates it.

it: Alcuni potrebbero dire "Non mi interessa se violano la mia privacy perché io non ho nulla da nascondere." Occorre fargli capire che stanno fraintendendo il concetto fondamentale dei diritti umani. Non occorre giustificare il motivo per cui si ha "bisogno" di un diritto: il carico della giustificazione ricade su chi cerca di infrangere quel determinato diritto. Ma anche se fosse, non puoi cedere i diritti altrui perché a te non sono utili. Ad esempio, la maggioranza non può votare contro i basilari diritti di una minoranza. Affermare che non si è interessati al diritto alla privacy perché non si ha nulla da nascondere è come dire che non si è interessati alla libertà di parola perché non si ha nulla da dire.
