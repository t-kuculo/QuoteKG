en: Instruction tables will have to be made up by mathematicians with computing experience and perhaps a certain puzzle-solving ability. There need be no real danger of it ever becoming a drudge, for any processes that are quite mechanical may be turned over to the machine itself.
en: In this paper I deal only with automatic machines, and will therefore often omit the prefix ɑ-.
en: The idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that these machines are intended to carry out any operations which could be done by a human computer.
en: Suppose Mother wants Tommy to call at the cobbler's every morning on his way to school to see if her shoes are done, she can ask him afresh every morning. Alternatively she can stick up a notice once and for all in the hall which he will see when he leaves for school and which tells him to call for the shoes, and also to destroy the notice when he comes back if he has the shoes with him.
it: Credo che alla fine del secolo l'uso delle parole e l'opinione delle persone di cultura saranno cambiate a tal punto che si potrà parlare di macchine pensanti senza aspettarsi di essere contraddetti.	en: I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.
it: Ai tempi di Galileo si affermava che i testi ""Stette fermo il sole in mezzo al cielo e non si affrettò a calare quasi un giorno intero"" e ""Hai fondato la terra sulle sue basi, mai potrà vacillare"" fossero una confutazione adeguata dalla teoria copernicana."  "en: I am not very impressed with theological arguments whatever they may be used to support. Such arguments have often been found unsatisfactory in the past. In the time of Galileo it was argued that the texts, ""And the sun stood still... and hasted not to go down about a whole day"" and ""He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not move at any time"" were an adequate refutation of the Copernican theory."
en: The ""computable"" numbers may be described briefly as the real numbers whose expressions as a decimal are calculable by finite means. ...According to my definition, a number is computable if its decimal can be written down by a machine. ...I show that certain large classes of numbers are computable. They include, for instance, the real parts of alls, the real parts of the zeros of the Bessel functions, the numbers π, e, etc. The computable numbers do not, however, include all definable numbers. ...onclusions are reached which are superficially similar to those of Gödel. ...t is shown ...that the Hilbertian can have no solution. In a recent paper... reaches similar conclusions..."

en: If one wants to make a machine mimic the behaviour of the human computer in some complex operation one has to ask him how it is done, and then translate the answer into the form of an instruction table. Constructing instruction tables is usually described as ""programming."

en: Another simile would be an atomic pile of less than critical size: an injected idea is to correspond to a neutron entering the pile from without. Each such neutron will cause a certain disturbance which eventually dies away. If, however, the size of the pile is sufficiently increased, the disturbance caused by such an incoming neutron will very likely go on and on increasing until the whole pile is destroyed. Is there a corresponding phenomenon for minds, and is there one for machines? There does seem to be one for the human mind. The majority of them seem to be ""sub-critical,"" i.e., to correspond in this analogy to piles of sub-critical size. An idea presented to such a mind will on average give rise to less than one idea in reply. A smallish proportion are super-critical. An idea presented to such a mind may give rise to a whole ""theory"" consisting of secondary, tertiary and more remote ideas. Animals minds seem to be very definitely sub-critical. Adhering to this analogy we ask, ""Can a machine be made to be super-critical?"
en: There is a remarkably close parallel between the problems of the physicist and those of the cryptographer. The system on which a message is enciphered corresponds to the laws of the universe, the intercepted messages to the evidence available, the keys for a day or a message to important constants which have to be determined. The correspondence is very close, but the subject matter of cryptography is very easily dealt with by discrete machinery, physics not so easily.
en: It is customary... to offer a grain of comfort, in the form of a statement that some peculiarly human characteristic could never be imitated by a machine. ... I cannot offer any such comfort, for I believe that no such bounds can be set.

en: For some purposes we might use machines whose motion is only partially determined by the configuration... When such a machine reaches... ambiguous configurations, it cannot go on until some arbitrary choice has been made by an external operator. This would be the case if we were using machines to deal with axiomatic systems.

en: Presumably the child-brain is something like a note-book as one buys it from the stationer's. Rather little mechanism, and lots of blank sheets.
en: Can machines think?""... The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the 'imitation game."" It is played with three people, a man , a woman , and an interrogator who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either ""X is A and Y is B"" or ""X is B and Y is A."" The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B... We now ask the question, ""What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?"" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, ""Can machines think?"
en: If an ɑ-machine prints two kinds of symbols, of which the first kind consists entirely of 0 and 1 , then the machine will be called a computing machine.

en: We do not wish to penalise the machine for its inability to shine in beauty competitions, nor to penalise a man for losing in a race against an aeroplane. The conditions of our game make these disabilities irrelevant.
en: This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be. We have to have some experience with the machine before we really know its capabilities. It may take years before we settle down to the new possibilities, but I do not see why it should not enter any one of the fields normally covered by the human intellect, and eventually compete on equal terms.
en: The view that machines cannot give rise to surprises is due, I believe, to a fallacy to which philosophers and mathematicians are particularly subject. This is the assumption that as soon as a fact is presented to a mind all consequences of that fact spring into the mind simultaneously with it. It is a very useful assumption under many circumstances, but one too easily forgets that it is false. A natural consequence of doing so is that one then assumes that there is no virtue in the mere working out of consequences from data and general principles.
de: Bei dem Versuch, solche Maschinen zu konstruieren, sollten wir nicht respektlos Gottes Macht, Seelen zu erschaffen, in irgendeiner Weise stärker an uns reißen, als wir es bei der Zeugung von Kindern tun: Vielmehr sind wir in beiden Fällen Werkzeuge Seines Willens, indem wir Wohnstätten für die Seelen, die Er erschafft, bereitstellen.
en: A digital computer can usually be regarded as consisting of three parts: Store. Executive unit. Control. ...The executive unit is the part which carries out the various individual operations involved in a calculation. ...It is the duty of the control to see that... instructions are obeyed correctly and in the right order. ...A typical instruction might say—""Add the number stored in position 6809 to that in 4302 and put the result back into the latter storage position."" Needless to say it would not occur in the machine expressed in English. It would more likely be coded in a form such as 6809430217. Here 17 says which of various possible operations is to be performed on the two numbers. ...It will be noticed that the instruction takes up 10 digits and so forms one packet of information..."

The activity of the intuition consists in making spontaneous judgements which are not the result of conscious trains of reasoning... The exercise of ingenuity in mathematics consists in aiding the intuition through suitable arrangements of propositions, and perhaps geometrical figures or drawings.
